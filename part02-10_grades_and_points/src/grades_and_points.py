# The table below outlines the grade boundaries on a 
# certain university course. Please write a program 
# which asks for the amount of points received and 
# then prints out the grade attained according to the table.


# points	grade
# < 0	impossible!
# 0-49	fail
# 50-59	1
# 60-69	2
# 70-79	3
# 80-89	4
# 90-100	5
# > 100	impossible!

# Some examples:

# Sample output
# How many points [0-100]: 37
# Grade: fail

# Sample output
# How many points [0-100]: 76
# Grade: 3

# Sample output
# How many points [0-100]: -3
# Grade: impossible!


# Write your solution here
